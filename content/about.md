I'm currently an undergraduate triple majoring in computer engineering, math, and economics at UC Santa Cruz. I'm interested in cybersecurity, hardware security, reverse engineering, malware, etc.

I like to code in:
- C/C++
- Python

but I'm able to use others when needed.

I've been programming since mid-2020 and doing cybersecurity and CTFs since early-2022.

This is just a blog where I'll mostly be posting writeups on stuff I do, notes, and other things I find interesting.

Now that you're here, why not read some of my [posts](/posts)?
