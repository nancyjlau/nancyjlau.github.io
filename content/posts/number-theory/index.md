## Intro

Number theory studies "numbers"
- Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N} = (0, 1, 2, ...)$
- Integers = $\mathbb{Z} = (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2)$
  - this is the set of numbers we will mostly focus on
    - the subset of positive integers will often be used. we will denote it by $\mathbb{Z_+}$. be aware that it is different from $\mathbb{N}$
    - the tuple $(\mathbb{Z}, +, \dot, 0, 1)$ forms a ring
- rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$
- real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
- complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$
- p-adic numbers $\mathbb{Q_p}$
  - made with rational numbers through a different *completion* process from that of $\mathbb{R}$

0 is not a positive integer but is a natural number

Topics in Number Theory
**Diophantine equations**
Equations in multiple unknowns and the interesting solutions are in a given set of numbers
- the equation $x+y=1$ has infinitely many integer solutions, while $2x+2y=1$ has no integer solutions

Linear Diophantine equation
- the equation $x^2+y^2=1$ has infinitely many rational solutions. they form rational points on the unit circle and are given by pythagorean    

Rational points in arithmetic geometric objects

- solutions of $y^2=x^3+ax+b$   
  
Elliptic curves

**Prime numbers**
- distribution of prime numbers

Prime Number Theorem   
Gaps between primes, infinitude of a certain type of primes   
RSA crypto system   

- transcendence/constructability
Related to questions asking whether a certain construction is possible
- square a circle: can there be a square with area $pi$   

Prove impossibility
